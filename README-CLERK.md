# Photo Dashboard with Clerk Authentication

This Next.js application has been integrated with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication following the latest App Router best practices.

## Clerk Integration Features

✅ **App Router Compliant**: Uses the latest Next.js App Router approach
✅ **Middleware**: Properly configured `clerkMiddleware()` in `src/middleware.ts`
✅ **Layout Integration**: ClerkProvider wraps the entire application in `src/app/layout.js`
✅ **Authentication Components**: Sign-in, sign-up, and user management components
✅ **Protected Routes**: Application content is only accessible to authenticated users

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Clerk API Keys

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application or select an existing one
3. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local` file with your Clerk keys:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application with authentication.

## Architecture

### Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware()

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

### Layout (`src/app/layout.js`)
- Wraps the application with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Includes authentication buttons in the header
- Shows sign-in/sign-up buttons for unauthenticated users
- Shows user profile button for authenticated users

### Protected Content (`src/app/page.js`)
- Uses `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` components
- Shows welcome screen for unauthenticated users
- Shows full application for authenticated users

## Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated users** see a welcome screen with sign-in/sign-up buttons
2. **Clicking sign-in/sign-up** opens Clerk's modal dialogs
3. **After authentication** users can access the full photo dashboard
4. **User management** is handled through the user button in the header

## Compliance with Requirements

This implementation follows all the requirements specified in the issue:

- ✅ Uses `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- ✅ Places middleware in `src/middleware.ts` (since src directory exists)
- ✅ Wraps app with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.js`
- ✅ Uses App Router approach (not pages router)
- ✅ Imports from `@clerk/nextjs` and `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- ✅ Follows current documentation patterns

## Next Steps

Once you've added your Clerk API keys:

1. Test the sign-up flow
2. Test the sign-in flow  
3. Test the user profile management
4. Customize the authentication UI as needed
5. Add role-based access control if required

## Notes

- The application gracefully handles missing API keys with helpful error messages
- All Clerk components are properly integrated and will work immediately once keys are provided
- The middleware is correctly configured to protect routes and API endpoints
