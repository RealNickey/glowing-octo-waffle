### Project Description
The project takes photos from storage, uploads it as a video to youtube, and then extracts the video back to storage in a video format. This effectively takes up less space in the storage.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Large collections of images quickly consume storage space and storing each image individually is inefficient and costly.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We convert images into a single compressed video file, upload the video to YouTube for cloud storage and retrieve and store the video back when needed, saving space.
