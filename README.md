# Spacetube üéØ


## Basic Details

### Team Name: CTRL Z

### Team Members

### Project Description
Spacetube is an innovative storage optimization solution that converts image collections into video format, uploads them as unlisted videos to YouTube, and retrieves them back as images when needed. This approach effectively reduces local storage requirements by leveraging YouTube's cloud infrastructure.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Large collections of images quickly consume storage space, and storing each image individually is inefficient and costly for users with limited storage capacity.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We convert multiple images into a single video file, upload the video to YouTube for free cloud storage, and provide functionality to retrieve and view the original images when needed, dramatically saving local storage space.
