### Project Description
The project takes photos from the user, uploads it as a unlisted video to youtube, and then extracts the video back to photo from the youtube link. This effectively helps us save storage.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Large collections of images quickly consume storage space and storing each image individually is inefficient and costly.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We convert images into a single  video file, upload the video to YouTube for cloud storage and retrieve and view the images when needed, saving space.
